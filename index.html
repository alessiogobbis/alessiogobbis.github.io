    <h2>Areas of Expertise and the AG+AI Method</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Alessio Gobbis’ practice has evolved beyond traditional financial advisory. After a solid background in managing <strong>SICAVs, mutual funds, and unit-linked products</strong> — now considered foundational but insufficient to excel — he has steered his approach toward a <strong>highly technical advisory service</strong>, grounded in <strong>data, algorithms, and quantitative forecasting powered by artificial intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence here does not replace human expertise but rather enhances it, providing unparalleled scientific calculation capabilities to recommend increasingly reliable and efficient instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, he has specialized in <strong>advanced quantitative analysis, financial programming, and predictive technologies</strong>, adopting a scientific approach to building <strong>efficient, risk-controlled portfolios</strong> with objective performance evaluation metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gobbis designs efficient portfolios leveraging <strong>professional software</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence tools</strong> that apply advanced quantitative methodologies to optimize every investment stage. The analyses and algorithms rely on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real historical data</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Risk and return metrics</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced optimization engines</strong>,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      capable of translating theoretical simulations into coherent, dynamic, and personalized portfolio compositions.
    </p>
    <p>Main application areas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Quantitative Asset Allocation and Efficient Frontier Construction</strong><br />
        Solutions are based on <strong>expected return and risk estimates for various asset classes</strong>, combined to identify optimal portfolios according to the principle of the <strong>best risk/volatility-adjusted return</strong>. The optimization engine enables the generation and periodic updating (e.g., every six months) of portfolios aligned with client risk profiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Historical Analyses and 36-Month Rolling Style Analysis</strong><br />
        Monthly data analyses on financial instruments and portfolios are conducted over 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons. In particular, the <strong>36-month rolling style analysis</strong> monitors the evolution of average fund composition and management activity over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monte Carlo Simulations and Volatility Cone</strong><br />
        Using probabilistic forecasting tools like the <strong>volatility cone</strong>, potential fluctuations in expected returns over the investment horizon are represented, enabling clients to manage risk expectations more consciously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Risk Budgeting and Multi-Objective Optimization</strong><br />
        Solutions are assessed with a <strong>multi-objective approach</strong>, considering not only returns but also stability, diversification, and portfolio compatibility. Optimization compares historical and current efficient frontiers, including flexible asset classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Financial Instrument Selection via Efficiency Indicators</strong><br />
        Tools like the <strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong> are employed to identify instruments that provide higher risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional static asset allocations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wealth Transfer Planning and Capital Protection</strong><br />
        The technical approach is integrated into a long-term strategic vision encompassing <strong>wealth protection, planned generational transfers, and safeguarding against unforeseen events</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>In summary</strong>, Dr. Gobbis applies a rigorous, data-driven methodology integrating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Historical and behavioral portfolio analyses;</li>
      <li>Mathematical algorithms for efficient portfolio construction;</li>
      <li>Performance indicators and risk management tools;</li>
      <li>Continuous optimization tailored to individual profiles and goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The aim is to build <strong>measurable, replicable, and consistent financial strategies over time</strong>, delivering value both in the accumulation and preservation phases of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solutions proposed are designed to ensure <strong>scalable, replicable, and measurable investment strategies</strong> focused on <strong>reducing uncertainty</strong> and <strong>optimizing the risk/return ratio</strong> over the long term.
